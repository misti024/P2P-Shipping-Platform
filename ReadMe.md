## Project Title

P2P Shipping Platform

## Project Description

The P2P Shipping Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) built on blockchain technology where users can offer and request shipping services. With this platform, individuals or businesses can find a carrier to transport goods or offer their services as a carrier. The platform handles payments and delivery confirmations via smart contracts, ensuring that both parties are protected and incentivized to fulfill their obligations.

The key idea is to decentralize shipping transactions, making them more secure, transparent, and efficient. No middlemen are needed, as smart contracts handle the payment flow and confirmations, making the process smooth and trustless.

## Project Vision

The vision of the P2P Shipping Platform is to create an open, efficient, and decentralized shipping ecosystem where individuals and businesses can connect directly. By using blockchain and smart contracts, the platform ensures that shipping services are provided with full transparency, reliability, and accountability, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This could revolutionize logistics, especially in markets where shipping services are often centralized and expensive.

## Future Scope

- **Global Shipping Network Integration:** Allow integration with global shipping carriers to create a worldwide shipping network.
- **Insurance Options:** Offer users the option to insure their shipments against damage or loss during transit.
- **Rating and Review System:** Implement a reputation system where both carriers and requesters can rate each other based on their experiences, fostering trust and quality service.
- **Automated Dispute Resolution:** Introduce a decentralized arbitration mechanism to handle disputes in case of delivery issues.
- **Multicurrency Support:** Implement support for various cryptocurrencies to facilitate international payments.

## Key Features

- **Shipment Creation:** Users can create shipping requests by specifying the carrier, shipment details, and payment amount.
- **Carrier and Requester Confirmation:** Both the carrier and the requester must confirm shipment details before the shipping process starts.
- **Delivery Confirmation:** Once the carrier delivers the goods, the requester can confirm the delivery, which triggers the release of the payment.
- **Smart Contract Payments:** Payments are locked in the smart contract until both parties confirm the delivery, ensuring fair and transparent transactions.
- **Payment Release:** After delivery confirmation, the platform automatically releases payment to the carrier.
